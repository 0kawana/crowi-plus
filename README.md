Getting Started to Develop
==========================

## Dependencies

- node 6.x (DON'T USE 7.x)
- npm 4.x
- yarn

* following environment is confirmed to work

    ```bash
    $ node -v
    v6.10.0
    
    $ npm -v
    4.6.1
    
    $ yarn --version
    0.24.5
    ```

## Build and Running the app
* `clone` this repository
* `npm install -g npm@4` to install required global dependencies
* `npm install` to install all dependencies or `yarn`
* `npm run build` to build client app
* `npm run server` to start the dev server in another tab

After you have installed all dependencies and build client you can now run the app. Run `npm run server` to start a local server using `node-dev` which will watch server-side codes and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.

### build and run server
```bash
# development
npm run build
npm run server
# production
npm run build:prod
npm run server:prod
```

## Other commands

### build client app
```bash
# development
npm run build:dev
# production
npm run build:prod
```

### watch client-side codes and incremental build
```bash
npm run build:dev:watch
```

### run unit tests
```bash
npm test
```
